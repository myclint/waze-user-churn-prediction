# waze-user-churn-prediction

In this repository, I analyzed user data and developed a machine learning model that predicts user churn.

## Data
* The Waze team was provided with the churn dataset.

## Approach
* The project was broken down into the following 5 tasks.
* Please refer to attached files for detailed explanations with code.

### Task 1 - Data Understanding
* In the data understanding stage, I took some time to inspect and understand the data to gain clear insights to prepare for the user churn prediction model.

### Task 2 - EDA
* In the EDA stage, I examined the provided dataset and prepared it for analysis.
* I also designed a professional data visualization that tells a story and will help data-driven decisions for business needs.

### Task 3 - Statistical Testing
* In the data exploration and hypothesis testing stage, I  explored the data provided further and conducted a hypothesis testing.

### Task 4 - Regression Modeling
* I built a binomial logistic regression model and evaluated the results.

### Task 5 - Machine Learning Model
* I used tree-based modeling techniques to predict a binary target class. The goal of the model is to predict if a customer will churn or be retained.
